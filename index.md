This robote would change how people look at other robote and how i could help me and other and my work would interest you to my robote
and i hop you would like the other idiea that i may creat over the spain of this program.

# Final Milestone

My final milestone, I've come a long way from where I started just a couple of months ago and have added a lot to my project. I've stripped away a lot of the parts that were originally on the robot to create room for my kicking arm. I changed the code a lot to accommodate the second H-Bridge which I go more in-depth about in my video below. I've loved this journey so far and I can't wait to see where this takes me in my future career.

My first milestone was being able to first build the Adruino car, then, be able to code using Arduino IDE allowing the car to move. Then
knowing how to take a hit and get back up again and think more better than give up on my self .I also have enough knowledge to be able to talk about how i code in detail what the Arduino Uno microcontroller is and how an H-Bridge works.That infare send IrReceiver decode to move my rc car than i connected my mimi breadboard to all the wire to place on my acylic plate.
